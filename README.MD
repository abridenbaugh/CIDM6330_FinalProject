Succession Plan Project

The audit in the utils.py files under succession_plan is ran, and it updates the date_audited field for the employees. 
After this has been ran, the signals assess the level of the employee. 
If the employee is higher a level 1, 2, or 3, then they will be added to the list of employees that need a succession plan.
